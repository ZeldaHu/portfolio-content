		<p>I love travel so much! I have visited US, Singapore, Tailand, and Japan. Travel to me means making friends with the locals and respecting their culture. It means spending time in dive bars and local restaurants because someone in passing recommended it to you. It means going places to truly explore, not just going places to say you’ve been there. It’s recognizing it’s better to stay in one country for a month than try to jam in three.</p>

		<p>My favourite place in the world is Hawaii! Hawaii is home of the world's most active volcano, the crater of Kilauea on Mauna Loa. Sandy beaches, towering volcanoes, and lush valleys lure thousands of tourists each year to this tropical paradise.
			Hawaii is the most ethnically and racially diverse state of any state in the union, a mix that includes Caucasians, Americans of Japanese descent, and Polynesians, among others. Native Hawaiians have held on to many of their customs and traditions despite the influx of non-natives over the years. Hawaii is the only state that has an official native language. Statehood had been proposed many times throughout Hawaii's history, but it was not until 1959 that Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States. Here are some photos of Hawaii! </p>
			<img src = "images/hawaii.jpeg" alt = "The photo shows a quiet, deep blue sea. A black girl in a bikini is sitting on a surfboard. In the distance there is a vague figure in the surf." />
			<img src = "images/hawaaii2.jpeg" alt = "This majestic photo was taken from mid-air. The left third of the photo is dark blue interspersed with green water, and the right two-thirds is land. A road winds through the land." />
			<img src = "images/hawaii3.jpeg" alt = "The volcano is erupting. Bright red lava erupted from the crater and arced in mid-air."/>
			<img src = "images/hawaii4.jpeg" alt = "This photo shows the majesty of the mountains. In the middle of the photo are the rolling mountains. The mountains are lush and green with meadows. There is a mountain trail in the middle. Above the mountains is a turquoise blue sky." />
			<img src = "images/hawaii5.jpeg" alt = "The background of the photo is a mountain with sharp angles. At the foot of the mountain is the dark sea. Where the mountains and the sea meet, there is some moss and the rest is bare. A small boat is floating on the sea." />
			<img src = "images/hawaii6.jpeg" alt = "In the center of the photo is a white, fresh egg flower in full bloom. Behind it are green branches." />
			<img src = "images/tree.jpeg" alt = "In the depths of the rainforest, everything is quiet. There is green and lush vegetation everywhere. A ray of sunlight shines on the big tree in the middle." />
			<img src = "images/dol.jpeg" alt = "Below sea level, a group of dolphins are playing and playing. There are seven dolphins in the picture. The sun is shining on the water and a lot of light is coming out of the water." />
			<img src = "images/aloha.jpeg" alt = "This photo was taken at an art bazaar on the beach in Hawaii. Some people have set up stalls and are selling handicrafts. Shells and wooden artwork were hanging by the side of the stall. It was in the shape of a surfboard and had aloha written on it." />
			<img src = "images/bus.jpeg" alt = "An orange double-decker bus travels across the waterfront on the south side of O'Hare Island. On the bus, "Free Ride" is written in English and Japanese. A short distance away was a beautiful beach with coconut trees. There were many happy tourists walking along the road." />
